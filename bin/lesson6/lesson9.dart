//   BITWISE OPERATORS
// =================================

// Step 1: Understand the concept of bitwise operations
// - Bitwise operations work on the binary (0s and 1s) representation of numbers.
// - They compare or modify the bits of numbers directly using specific operators.

// Step 2: Define the variables
// - Choose two numbers to perform bitwise operations on.
// - Example:
//   Let a = ___ (convert this number to binary)
//   Let b = ___ (convert this number to binary)
// - Add a third variable c to store the result after each operation.

//  Perform AND operation
// - The AND operator (`&`) compares each bit of two numbers.
// - Rule: The result is 1 only if both bits are 1. Otherwise, the result is 0.
// - Example:
//   a = ___ -> Binary: ______
//   b = ___ -> Binary: ______
//   a & b = ______ -> Binary result: ______ -> Decimal: ______
// - Write the binary alignment and solve step by step manually.

//  Perform OR operation
// - The OR operator (`|`) compares each bit of two numbers.
// - Rule: The result is 1 if at least one bit is 1. Otherwise, the result is 0.
// - Example:
//   a = ___ -> Binary: ______
//   b = ___ -> Binary: ______
//   a | b = ______ -> Binary result: ______ -> Decimal: ______
// - Write the binary alignment and solve step by step manually.

//  Perform XOR operation
// - The XOR operator (`^`) compares each bit of two numbers.
// - Rule: The result is 1 if the bits are different. Otherwise, the result is 0.
// - Example:
//   a = ___ -> Binary: ______
//   b = ___ -> Binary: ______
//   a ^ b = ______ -> Binary result: ______ -> Decimal: ______
// - Write the binary alignment and solve step by step manually.

//  Perform Left Shift operation
// - The Left Shift operator (`<<`) shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of places.
// - Rule: For every shift, add a 0 on the right, and bits on the left are discarded.
// - Example:
//   a = ___ -> Binary: ______
//   a << n = ______ -> Binary result: ______ -> Decimal: ______
// - Write the binary alignment and solve step by step manually.

//  Perform Right Shift operation
// - The Right Shift operator (`>>`) shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of places.
// - Rule: For every shift, the rightmost bits are discarded.
// - Example:
//   a = ___ -> Binary: ______
//   a >> n = ______ -> Binary result: ______ -> Decimal: ______
// - Write the binary alignment and solve step by step manually.

//  Practical Applications
// - Understand why bitwise operations are useful:
//   1. Networking: Work with IP addresses and protocols.
//   2. Cryptography: Encryption and decryption.
//   3. Graphics: Manipulate images or colors at the pixel level.
//   4. Embedded Systems: Control hardware like sensors or motors efficiently.
